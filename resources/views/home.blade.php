        <h1>Ebooks Description</h1>
        <p> An ebook (short for electronic book), also known as an e-book or eBook, is a book publication made available in digital form, 
          consisting of text, images, or both, readable on the flat-panel display of computers or other electronic devices. Although sometimes 
          defined as "an electronic version of a printed book", some e-books exist without a printed equivalent.

        <h1>Characteristic</h1>
        <p>For starters, eBooks are files that you can read on a digital device â€“ a tablet, smartphone, computer, etc. But again, considering 
          other files can be read on digital devices (i.e. word documents) eBooks have specific characteristics that differentiate them.</p>
